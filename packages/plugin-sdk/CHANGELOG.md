# @capybara-hq/plugin-sdk

## 0.1.0-rc.3

### Minor Changes

- f222ff8: Agent templates describe a whole agent: `selectedSkills`, `connectors` (a connector template of the
  plugin, or a described need), `subagents` (general, template types, inline types), `modelRef`,
  `quickActions` and `instructionFiles`, all optional with limits; existing files parse unchanged.
  A connector entry may carry `policies` (tool name to `ask` / `deny`); an inline sub-agent's
  `tools` is optional (absent = all of the agent's tools, `[]` = none).
  A sub-agent dispatch resolves a template's `selectedSkills` names without pinning them.
- 2a12327: Marketplace entries accept `deprecated: true | { reason? }` (SDK `MarketplaceEntry.deprecated`,
  normalized by `marketplaceEntryDeprecation`; JSON Schema regenerated). A maintainer sets it by hand
  on a published version's entry; `capybara-plugin marketplace --write` keeps it, and the `--base`
  integrity rules ignore it. The kernel returns `deprecated` on marketplace entries, never reports a
  deprecated version as newer or as an item's latest marketplace version, picks the newest stable
  non-deprecated compatible version when an import names none, and refuses importing or requesting a
  deprecated version with 409 `marketplace.entry_deprecated`. The market lists show the newest stable
  version on each row (prereleases fold into 其他版本 unless no stable version can be imported) and
  list deprecated versions under 其他版本 as 已废弃, with the reason, not importable.
- 12fd552: Marketplaces list one entry per plugin. `plugin.json` `description` accepts `{ en, zh? }` as well as a string (English; read it with the SDK's `pluginDescription`), and marketplace entries accept an optional `displayName: { zh, en }`. `capybara-plugin marketplace --write` keeps one entry per public plugin at its current version, with `summary` from the localized description and `displayName` from `plugin.json`, replacing a plugin's entry when its version moves; `--check --base` replaces `marketplace-append-only` with `marketplace-version-decrease` (an entry's version only increases) and `marketplace-integrity` (a published version keeps its integrity). `capybara-plugin check` warns, without failing, when a public plugin's description has no `zh` (`release-description-zh`; findings may now be warnings). The kernel returns an entry's `displayName` (null without one) and searches it, and a single-plugin git marketplace takes the summary and display name from `plugin.json`; a catalog item keeps the English description. The market lists show the display name, else the name. model-fake gets a Chinese description.
  
  `--write` also refreshes a listed entry's `summary` and `displayName` from `plugin.json` (`marketplace-display-stale` in `--check`), and `marketplace-version-decrease` also fires when a plugin moves back to an older version a base in the older form lists. Catalog item views (admin and org) and the import review carry `descriptionZh` (the latest version's Chinese description, or null), and the plugin pages show the description in the UI language.
  
  Release order: release core and upgrade the deployed kernels before `capybara-hq/plugins` publishes
  plugins whose `description` is an object (older kernels reject it) and before the official
  marketplace drops older versions.

## 0.1.0-rc.2

### Minor Changes

- 0ec51d1: Config UI hints: `ui(schema, hints)` attaches presentation hints (labels, help, widgets, options,
  sections, array items, presets, secrets drawn per item) to an extension config schema;
  `configJsonSchema` turns a config schema into the JSON Schema for forms (`x-ui`, `x-secret`,
  `x-hot`, titles from labels, no values under secrets) and `validateConfigUi` checks the hints.
  `secret()` now merges with existing meta. `plugin.json` accepts `extension.configSchemas`. The
  kernel's config JSON Schema now comes from the SDK (`hot` is emitted as `x-hot`).
  
  Compatibility (pre-1.0 ruling): a plugin packed by the new plugin-tools that declares config
  carries `extension.configSchemas`, which an older kernel's strict section parser refuses
  ("unrecognized key") rather than through the SDK range. Kernel and plugins move together before
  1.0, so upgrade the kernel before importing such plugins.
- 8892d50: Add the `web-search@1` and `web-fetch@1` extension points (`WebSearchProvider`, `WebFetchProvider`, `WebProviderError`, `isPublicHostname`), `ExtensionPointInfo.selection`, and the `web_fetch` model call purpose. A `web-fetch@1` provider that fetches from inside the deployment must refuse non-public addresses after DNS resolution (documented on `WebFetchProvider`).

## 0.1.0-rc.1

### Patch Changes

- 8bf0b04: The builtin tools take Claude Code's names: `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`,
  `Deliver`, `Skill`, `SkillWrite`, `AskUserQuestion`, `ReadToolOutput`, `ToolSearch` and `Agent`
  (formerly `sandbox_bash` … `sandbox_deliver`, `skill_load`, `skill_write`, `ask_user`,
  `read_tool_output`, `tool_search` and `agent`). Every description, error and system text that names
  a builtin uses the new names; a request recorded before the rename is rebuilt with the old texts,
  so it replays with no drift. Several parameters are renamed as well (see the builtin tool
  parameters changeset).
- 32580d3: Model-visible tool keys of connectors are `mcp__<slug>__<tool>` and those of extensions
  `plugin__<plugin>__<tool>` (aligned with Claude Code). The SDK exports `parseToolKey`,
  `connectorToolKey`, `extensionToolKey`, `ParsedToolKey` and `BUILTIN_TOOL_NAME_RE`; hook payloads'
  `toolKey` carry the new keys, so an extension that matches keys should use `parseToolKey`.
