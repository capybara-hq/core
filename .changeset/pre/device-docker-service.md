"@capybara-hq/device": patch
---

`capybara-device` gains Docker mode (commands run with `docker exec` in one container per environment from the published sandbox image, the environment directory mounted at `/workspace`, `/skills` and `/tmp`; no network unless the effective egress allows some, with no domain allowlist) and `service install|uninstall` (a launchd agent on macOS, a systemd user unit on Linux).
